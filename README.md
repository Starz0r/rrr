# rrr - Restore, Reuse, Recycle

rrr is the safe CLI delete utility. The equivalent is `Remove-Item` on Windows or `rm` on other systems, but instead of removing the file from your drive completely, it moves the file to the system or user defined "trash bin".

## Usage

```
$> rrr .\some_file.txt
All file(s) trashed successfully.
```
